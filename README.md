A bunch of Windows cmd aliases that can make work in Windows cmd environment a bit more pleasant and faster.

Use them like this:

1. Create a new folder `C:\Aliases`
2. Copy files from this repo into the new folder
3. Add the folder into `PATH`

Then you can type e.g. `ll`, and it will be equivalent to the content of `ll.bat` file: `ls -la --color`.
